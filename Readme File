--------------------------------  ABOUT PROJECT ---------------------------------

Developed a python based student data management project. Create a small repository of the students of College and the courses they are enrolled in. 
It will create records of new students as well as courses, allocate courses to the students and display them accordingly at the same time. 
The prject is made using tkinter GUI library for all frontend screen designs and 
JSON (Javascript Object Notation) files to store all the data at the backend.
The project is divided into five modules. The home screen of the application would provide a tab control view of all modules 
allowing you to work on them at the same time.
